The simplification means that a few FSIII concepts that are valid both before and after the simplification have a change in their display-term. The old term is added as a designation in 2.1.0 (2.0.0 only had the new term). In 2.1.0 a few errors in descriptions, have also been corrected between 2.0.0 and 2.1.0\r\nFFB has no changes.\r\nCareSocialCodes has been updated with new codes needed to support StatusReason, Type used in ServiceRequest and CancellationTypes used in CarePlan."

It is consistent with the municipality standard, FBU in version 1.2.0. The change is significant with almost all the old concepts being removed and new concepts added.\r\nFSIII has been updated with all the changes related to the simplification (forenklingen). All the details of the simplification are not be reported here, due to the extend of it, but documentation can be found here: https://www.kl.dk/sundhed-og-aeldre/data-dokumentation-og-digitalisering/faelles-sprog-iii/forenkling-af-faelles-sprog-iii. Notice that no concepts have been removed from the code system yet. This is done to support a transfer-phase, where both new and old concepts can be used for reporting. Retiering concepts will be removed in a comming version of kl-term expected to launch October 2025. Notice that FSIII classic uses its legacy codes as well as uuids e.g. For Personlig hygiejne both H1.1 and 17312894-b23f-43d9-9723-b725ac25d872 are accepted.\r\nFFB has only experienced minor corrections in descriptions.\r\nCareSocialCodes have been updated with several new values for who is the source of some information (kilde). Most of them originally come from FFInst, but the codes will be maintained here from now on. Municipality codes for encounter class i.e. the way an encounter is delivered has been added af well. Note that only two codes are added, because codes native for HL7 FHIR is utilized for other options. A few displays have been changed to be consistent with new naming conventions for municipality areas."

The version of each CodeSystem has been set to the date of the actual migration. \nFBOE is released in its initial version.\nFSIII has been updated with §140 and §119 interventions with detailed concepts for when interventions are delivered individually or in a group. A number of headings in FSIII classic have changed display e.g. H4 changed from SEL § 84 stk. 2 to Midlertidigt ophold. Notice that FSIII classic uses its legacy codes e.g. H1, rather than the new uuid from FK-klassifikation. This is to preseve the implementations already relying on the legacy codes.\nFFB has changed term from Omgivelsesfaktorer to Omgivelser for 7445fb2b-0009-43d9-b49b-1b9782f2fcd9. The new concept a56d59c0-c8fd-468c-85f9-b67f66561b90 Omgivelsesfaktorer has been added.\nCareSocialCodes have been updated with reasons for stopping an intervention, see 2c059407-fed5-4852-92d8-6bb5ad63d7bb Begrundelse for indsatsophør and its subtype descendants. In addition the term Rehabilitering efter § 140 have been changed to Genoptræning efter §140, and two subtypes have been added. Two subtypes have also been added to Sundhedsfremme og forebyggelse §119."
