The version of each CodeSystem has been set to the date of the actual migration. \nFBOE is released in its initial version.\nFSIII has been updated with §140 and §119 interventions with detailed concepts for when interventions are delivered individually or in a group. A number of headings in FSIII classic have changed display e.g. H4 changed from SEL § 84 stk. 2 to Midlertidigt ophold. Notice that FSIII classic uses its legacy codes e.g. H1, rather than the new uuid from FK-klassifikation. This is to preseve the implementations already relying on the legacy codes.\nFFB has changed term from Omgivelsesfaktorer to Omgivelser for 7445fb2b-0009-43d9-b49b-1b9782f2fcd9. The new concept a56d59c0-c8fd-468c-85f9-b67f66561b90 Omgivelsesfaktorer has been added.\nCareSocialCodes have been updated with reasons for stopping an intervention, see 2c059407-fed5-4852-92d8-6bb5ad63d7bb Begrundelse for indsatsophør and its subtype descendants. In addition the term Rehabilitering efter § 140 have been changed to Genoptræning efter §140, and two subtypes have been added. Two subtypes have also been added to Sundhedsfremme og forebyggelse §119."
