            information technology. The Danish affiliate is dedicated to profiling and integrating standards into
            national use. HL7 Denmark's vision is to create the best and most widely used standards in healthcare
            through a common definition of ethical rules and a comprehensive framework.

            is HL7's next generation standards framework.
